K6 Load Testing / Performance Testing


Each test type teaches you something different about your system.

##### _Smoke tests verify that your system can handle minimal load, without any problems._
##### _Load tests assess system performance in terms of concurrent users or requests per second._
##### _Stress and Spike tests assess the limits and stability of your system under extreme conditions._
##### _Soak tests assess the reliability and performance of your system over an extended period of time._
